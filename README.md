  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)

  ## Description
  My task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.
  
  The README must include:
  * Project Title Sections entitled ‘Description’, Table of Contents’, ‘Installation’, ‘Usage’, ‘License’, ‘Contributing’, ‘Tests’, ‘Questions’.
  * When a user is prompted to enter inputs for each section the results are displayed in the corresponding sections.
  * When a user chooses a licence for their project a badge display the license should be displayed near the top of the page.
  * The user should enter their GitHub username and email address and have it displayed in the Questions section.
  * When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents they should be taken to the corresponding section of the README.
  
  ## Table of Contents
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [License](#license)
  * [Contributing](#contributing)
  * [Tests](#tests)
  * [Questions](#questions)
  
  ## Installation
  A user will need to clone the repository to their local machine and run npm install to install the Inquirer package.

  ## Usage
  The application is run by typing 'node install.js' into the command line and the user will be prompted with the questions. A project title, description, GitHub account name and email address are all required fields. If any other field is left blank then 'N/A' is returned. When all questions have been answered the README.md file is created.
